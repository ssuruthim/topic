    <h1>FILTER PROPERTY</h1>
   <p> The filter property defines visual effects (like blur and saturation) to an element</p>
   <img id="myimg" src="firefox-logo.svg" width="300" height="300" >
   <p><b>BLUR:</b>blur the image,The radius of the blur, specified as a length.</p>
   <p><b>BRIGHTNESS:</b>The brightness() CSS function applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear brighter or darker.
The brightness of the result, specified as a number or a percentage.
     A value under 100% darkens the image,
      while a value over 100% brightens it.
       A value of 0% will create an image that is completely black,
        while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. The initial value for interpolation is 1.</p>
        <p>brightness(0%)   Completely black </p>
            <P>brightness(0.4)   40% brightness </P>
          <P>  brightness(1)    No effect </P>
          <p>  brightness(200%)  Double brightness </p>
<p><b>CONTRAST:</b>The contrast of the result, specified as a number or a percentage. A value under 100% decreases the contrast, while a value over 100% increases it. A value of 0% will create an image that is completely gray, while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged.</p>
<p><b>DROP-SHADOW()</b>drop-shadow(16px 16px 10px black)</
<div>16 px is a x axiz in horizantal </div>
<div>16 px is a y axiz in vertical </div>
<div>10 px is a blur radius  </div>
<div>black is a color</div>
</p>
<p><b>GRAYSCALE:</b>grayscale(0)      No effect 
    grayscale(.7)     70% grayscale 
    grayscale(100%)   Completely grayscale </p>
    <P><b>HUE-ROTATE:</b>Applies a hue rotation on the image. The value defines the number of degrees around the color circle the image samples will be adjusted. 0deg is default, and represents the original image.(-90deg)  Same as 270deg rotation */
        hue-rotate(0deg)     No effect 
        hue-rotate(90deg)    90deg rotation 
        hue-rotate(.5turn)   180deg rotation
        hue-rotate(405deg)   Same as 45deg rotation </P>
        <p><b>INVERT:</b>invert(0)  :    No effect 
            invert(.6):    60% inversion 
            invert(100%):   Completely inverted </p>

<P><b>OPACITY:</b>Sets the opacity level for the image. The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where:

    0% is completely transparent.
    100% (1) is default and represents the original image (no transparency).</P>

<P><b>SATURATE:</b>The amount of the conversion, specified as a number or a percentage. A value under 100% desaturates the image, while a value over 100% super-saturates it. A value of 0% is completely unsaturated(image is hown in gray color), while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. The initial value for interpolation is 1.

</P>
<P><b>SEPHIA:</b>The amount of the conversion, specified as a number or a percentage. A value of 100% is completely sepia, while a value of 0% leaves the input unchanged. Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. The initial value for interpolation is 0.
    sepia(0)      No effect 
    sepia(.65)    65% sepia 
    sepia(100%)  Completely sepia </P>
